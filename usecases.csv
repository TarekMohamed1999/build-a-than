FG-AN-usecase-006,"Automation and intelligent OAM(operation, maintenance and management) of radio network ",[FGAN-I-008],,,"Background: Dynamic radio environment, network structure, user behaviour, and user distribution drive the network needs to  be monitored and optimised continually. Currently, it consumes experts a lot of time and labor work to discover problems, analyze root cause, and then formulating solutions of radio networks. Therefore, AI and big data technology is necessary to achieve full process automation and intelligent management of wireless network.
Specifically, wireless network autonomous management  includes  real-time monitoring of data quality, quasi-real-time diagnosis of abnormal cells, root cause analysis, recommended solutions, and evaluation of processing effects.
Real-time monitoring of data quality
It is needed to firstly collect real-time data from the 4/5G integrated network management, then compares the consistency of the number of network elements from the data, and achieves data quality monitoring and warning through the visualization panel.
Quasi-real-time diagnosis of abnormal cells
Using several categories of KPI performance indicators, the ML algorithm (e.g. OneClassSVM ) is used to diagnose network elements in these categories of scenarios such as residential and colleges on a daily/weekly basis, and distribute them to frontline managers according to the abnormal probability.
Root cause analysis and recommended solutions
Through collecting tens of thousands of expert experiences, and radio network knowledge bases have been established through knowledge graphs to develop intelligent recommendation algorithms and search engines, and to directly  provide reasons and recommend solutions of each abnormal network element to first-line experts, thus reducing troubleshooting time and error rate.
Evaluation of processing effects

Compared with traditional antenna, there are more dimensions of parameters to adjust for massive MIMO large-scale antenna array, including horizontal lobe width, vertical lobe width, azimuth, dip angle and beam number. Each dimension can be fine adjusted by setting a reasonable step size and theoretically and there may be tens of thousands possible combination of antenna parameter weights in a cell. Therefore, manual optimization and adjustment based on scenario/service changes can be very hard in consideration of multi-cell coordination.
The autonomous massive MIMO use case is about helping operators quickly converge and achieve optimal adjustment of antenna parameters with AI capabilities of multi-dimensional analysis and prediction. The general workflow is: 5G base station collects position information from UE and sends it to the network management system, which then calculates the distribution of UE and finds the optimal weight combination with ML algorithms based on the target RSRP/SINR distribution in the current scenario, so as to maximize the utilization of system capacity and guarantee the user experience.

FG-AN-usecase-9,Network resource allocation for emergency management based on closed loop analysis,FGAN-I-090-R2,22/April/2021,"Discussions during [FGAN-I-055-R1], [FGAN-I-054-R1], [FGAN-I-072]","Telecommunication systems are critical pillar of emergency management. A set of hierarchical AI/ML based closed loops could be used to intelligently deploy and manage slice for emergency responders in the affected area. A higher closed loop in the OSS can be used for detecting which area is affected by the emergency and deploy a slice for emergency responders to that area. It can then set a resource arbitration policy for the lower closed loop in RAN. The lower loop can use this policy to intelligently share RAN resources between the public and emergency responder slice. It can also intelligently manage ML pipelines across the edge and emergency responder devices by using split AI/ML models or offloading of inference tasks from the devices to the edge.
Following are related steps in this use case scenario:
MNO may instruct OSS to detect certain set of emergencies and provide connectivity to emergency responders according to predefined SLA.

NOTE- e.g. this input may be provided using an operator intent.

OSS might deploy a closed loop to achieve this. It might collect data from sources like network analytics data, social media scraping, input from emergency responders etc. 

NOTE- e.g. such inputs may be provided from nRT-RICs or other xNFs in the network.

OSS might use AI/ML models to detect emergency and deploy an ER slice to the location. It might also create high level strategy/policy to reallocate resources among the slices.

NOTE- e.g. such closed loops may be hosted in non-RT RIC and may be used for predictive resource allocations to specific edge locations based on predicted needs, in turn based on detected emergency.
NOTE- the policy to reallocate resources may depend, among other things, on the type of emergency e.g. a natural disaster, earth quake, a law and order situation, traffic accidents, etc.

RAN domain might use this high-level strategy/policy and possibly other inputs from emergency responders to create a closed loop to arbitrate resources among RAN NSSIs.

NOTE- e.g. such closed loops may be hosted nearer to edge e.g. nRT RIC. The policy input from higher loop may indicate, among other things, the different sources of data for the lower loop.

RAN domain closed loop might also decide to offload inference tasks from ER devices to the edge or use split AI/ML model to run inference tasks on edge and ER device. This decision might be taken based on available network and compute resources.

NOTE- e.g. some layers of the AI/ML model may be hosted in the wearable devices of the emergency responders, which will help in say locating of persons under distress using various inputs.
Relation with autonomous behavior- 
Workflows for the closed loops are independent of each other. The only interaction between closed loops is via high level intents over the inter-loop interface. 
Closed loops can create new closed loops in other network domains without human intervention.
Although loops are deployed in hierarchical fashion, each loop has the ability to evolve independently. It can use different models and ML pipelines as required. Each loop may move up or down the autonomy levels as defined in [ITU-T Y.3173].
Closed loops have ability to split and provision AI/ML models to other closed loops in automated fashion.  
By making closed loops in edge domain autonomous, we also enable lesser orchestration delay, better privacy and flexibility for verticals (e.g., industrial campus networks).
Higher loops can use historical knowledge available to them to optimize and generalize lower loops using high-level intent. This increases efficiency of lower loops while preserving their autonomy. (e.g., higher loop might know certain kind of ML models are good for cyclone emergency management based on previous cyclones.)

NOTE: This use case might be well aligned with the use case “Composable, hierarchical closed loops” in [FGAN-I-072] and others above.","1. The ""propagation"" and ""escalation"" of intents is something which needs study.
2.  mixing the concept of ""declarative"" policies with ""top-level"" intent with the concept of (propagation/escalation) needs study.
3. recursive decomposition coupled with recursive policy mapping
4. The components (“nodes”) of the high-level service are decomposed into more concrete services (possibly recursively). Declarative policies must be “translated” into more concrete declarative policies on the decomposed services in conjunction. – how to do this?
5. By coupling “event/condition/action” control loops with TOSCA’s substitution mapping feature, you can make these control loops “cascading”, i.e. they can propagate down from high-level abstract “intent” statements to low-level device reconfigurations, and they can escalate back up if necessary. This is an aspect of TOSCA policies that needs study. ",Cat 1: describes a scenario related to core autonomous behavior itself.  , [b-ETSI GS ZSM 001] ,"High

FG-AN-usecase-010,Inter-domain service automation (IDSA) - for microfinance,AN-I-060,29/March/2021,Discussions regarding cloud interoperability in 5G use case lab,"Microfinance applications may be hosted by non-experts in 5G or any form of cloud / ICT technologies. The end-user requirements are domain-specific e.g. loan management, banking account/ledger management etc. The main stakeholders who are enterprises (e.g. banks) may be knowledgeable and would like to focus only in their business workflows (as against cloud / ICT technologies). The underlying cloud infrastructure (for that matter the application design) and the network infrastructure (5G, 6G, or (x+1)G) is immaterial to a bank / finance manager. 
However, from a technology perspective the following rewards are desired to be reaped:
1. Give the best end-user experience: e.g. reduce down-time for services, reduced latencies for services, security and data privacy, intelligent services, by exploiting the best cloud service deployment for the microfinance application. e.g. edge, load balancing, secure messaging across multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud, AI/ML services via distributed cloud, etc.
2. Insulate the end-user from xG -> (x+1)G migration: by providing interoperable, standard, backward compatible networking abstraction technologies. Integrating service lifecycle management pipeline provides agility to service development and testing.
3. Mitigate the risk of increased integration service costs: by using open source technologies, standards, benchmarking, automating in test beds.
4. Automate: reducing human involvement reduces training costs for banks, operational costs in networks and brings other benefits like intelligent fault isolation without depending on 3rd party service providers.

Frequently bank branches have to fall back on costly and complex connectivity through satellites. Other than the capital and operational aspects, the bank staff also needs to handle the link failover and maintenance activities in case of issues. Furthermore, such solutions do not allow local community to utilize the network. 
Autonomous last hop connectivity both through 4G/5G as well as other non 3GPP heterogeneous networks need to be seamlessly enabled to operate in an affordable manner. The solution is likely to provide the following benefits:
1. Based on the requirements from the verticals, provide connectivity for rural FI sites independent of network providers/large-Telco.
2. Allow the connectivity to be shared with local community to ensure better return on investments.
3. Edge compute and related infrastructure can enable more compelling deployments for digital FI as well as other verticals (e.g. short term tele-commute / interviews etc.).
4. Automate operations and security audits: reducing human involvement in maintaining and running the edge / last hop reduces training costs for banks, operational costs in networks and brings other benefits like intelligent fault isolation without depending on 3rd party service providers, continuous audit of deployed solution for security etc.
